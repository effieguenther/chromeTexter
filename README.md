# focusReader
Focus Reader is a chrome extension that lets the user reformat the text on any webpage. These reformatting tools can improve reading speed and focus for everyone, but they are specifically designed to combat challenges of ADD/ADHD and dyslexia. 


Tool #1: Bionic Reading

    Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word. The user can click a switch which reformats larger blocks of text on the website to Bionic Reading.

Tool #2: Easy to read fonts

    Some webpages might be in hard to read fonts. This tool lets the user select a famously easy to read font - Arial, Helvetica, or Comic Sans MS - from a drop down menu.


Tool #3/4: Adjust letter and line spacing

    These + and - buttons allow the user to adjust the spacing between letters and lines on the webpage. There is no maximum, but there is a minimum for each which prevents the user from making the text completely unreadable.
